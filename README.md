## na2-exec-nsi-scripts

OpenNSA NSI scripts to use with [NA2 exec plugin](https://github.com/RENCI-NRIG/na2-exec-plugin).

## Setup

The scripts require an installation of OpenNSA somewhere and adjusting the env.bash script. All scripts take some command-line parameters, using `-h` will explain the use. For provision requests there is a special `-l params.sh` option that sources an additional file filled with sane values for provisioning a connection.
